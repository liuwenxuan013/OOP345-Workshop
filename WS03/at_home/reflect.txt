1. The reason for specializing the sum() member function:
    Because the logic of addition of numbers and strings are different. The logic for adding strings is to concatenate sting instead of adding values.

 
2. The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.   
    Because we initialize int and string in different way. For example: 
	template<>
	int SummableLVPair<std::string, int>::dValue = 0;

	template<>
	std::string SummableLVPair<std::string, std::string>::dValue = "\0";

3. The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.
      We need to define the class variable outside the class template for some special case whose logic does not fit this class template rule.

Reflection for Workshop 6 
-The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL.
-Why there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code.
-How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case.

Because using the vector containers is more flexible than other other available container. The size of vector could meet the variable number of the inside elements without pre-declaring a fixed size. in this project, adding an element to vector container by calling push_back() function, therefore, the size of the vector container automatically expanded.

In this workshop, the vector container can automatically manage its size, therefore there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code.

The range-based for simplify the coding in this case:
 Using "for_each(proList.begin(),proList.end(),[&](iProduct* p)" no need to tracked the index and no need to worry about the number of elements of the container as well.

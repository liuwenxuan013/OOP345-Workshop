1.Copy operation allocates memory for the left operands, and it will not change the right operands;
Move operation is shadow copying which does not allocate new memory for left operands, and it will remove the original values

2.Move operation remove value and memory from the original object, give the values and the address of those memory to the new object instead. For example, Text d=std::move(a); This execution will  remove the memory and instance variable's values from object a, and give the value and address of memory to the new object d.

3.I add move constructor and move assignment operator in Text module and add these move operation function call in w2 module to upgrade my code.

To compare the time duration of different constructor and assignment execution, move operation is more efficient than copy operation.
